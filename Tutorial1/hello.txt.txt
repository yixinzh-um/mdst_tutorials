Hello! I’m Yixin Zheng. I’m pursuing the degree in data analytics and science in Master of Information program. I’m doing the dual degree so this is my first year in MSI and also second year in Master of Architecture. I come from southeast of China, where it never snows, so it is a great difference for me living in Ann Arbor. Last thanks giving I went to boyne mountain and enjoyed the skiing here!
